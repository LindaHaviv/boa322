# Deploy ML-powered music genre classifier and deploying it on AWS using AWS Lambda, Amazon EFS and Amazon S3
Repository for deploying multiple machine learning models for inference on AWS Lambda and Amazon EFS 

## Introduction 

In this repo, you will find all the code needed to deploy your application for Machine Learning Inference using AWS Lambda and Amazon EFS. 

## Application Workflow 

Here is the architectural work flow of our application:

- Create a serverless application which will __trigger__ a Lambda function upon a new model upload in your `S3 bucket`. And the function would copy that file from your S3 bucket to `EFS File System`

- Create another Lambda function that will load the model from `Amazon EFS` and performs the __prediction__ based on an image.

- Build and deploy both the application using  `AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)` application.

# Architecture 

To use the Amazon EFS file system from Lambda, you need the following:

- An Amazon __Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)__
- An __Amazon EFS__ file system created within that VPC with an access point as an application entry point for your __Lambda function__.
- A __Lambda function__ (in the same VPC and private subnets) referencing the access point.

The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture:

# Create an Amazon EFS file system, access point, and Lambda function

Now, we are going to use a single SAM deployment to deploy this, which will create the following two serverless applications, letâ€™s call it :

- __app1(s3-efs)__: The serverless application which will transfer the uploaded ML models from your S3 bucket to the your EFS file system
- __app2(ml-inference)__: The serverless application which will perform the ML Inference from the client.

# Steps to deploy 

1. Create a project directory:

```
$ mkdir my-ml-project
$ cd my-ml-project
```

2. Create a new serverless application in AWS SAM using the following command:

```
sam init
```

Choose Custom Template Location (`Choice`: `2`) as the template source, and provide the following GitHub template location:

https://github.com/debnsuma/boa322.git

3. Build the AWS SAM application

```
sam build --use-container
```

4. Deploy the application
```
sam deploy --guided
```
5. Provide a unique `Stack Name` and `SrcBucket` name

7. Once the Application is deployed, keep a note of the API Gateway endpoint (we would need this at `Step 8` for inference)

6. Upload the ML model

```
aws s3 cp models.p s3://<THE BUCKET NAME YOU PROVIDED WHILE DEPLOYING THE SAM APPLICATION>
```

7. Perform ML inference : Use POSTMAN or API GW UI for inference, use the following in the body 

```
{
    "song_name": "blues.00099.6.wav" # Replace this with song of your choice
}
```
